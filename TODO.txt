----------------

Clamp the contact area between radar limits.
Area is an Ellipse bounded by the annulus sector of the radar.
Maybe a composite shape type that takes multiple shapes and 'masks' them together.

----------------

Work in some actual error handling.
Would be useful to have an error handler at the top level that prints the last 5 or so unhandled
errors.

----------------

Look at rust gui / event loop architecture for ideas on how to add common behaviour between ship
classes / roles.

----------------

Create more concrete types around Vec2 and f64 to differentiate beteen point/vector, angle/distance,
etc. (maybe even relative/absolute).

struct AbsolutePoint(Point)
struct RelativePoint{point: Point, reference: Point} <- could reference be a const generic?

----------------

Integrate a Kalman filter to increase accuracy of radar contacts.
